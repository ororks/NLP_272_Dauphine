# Project Setup Guide

## Creating and Setting Up a Virtual Environment


1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - **Windows**:
     ```sh
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **MacOS/Linux**:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install requirements and constraints**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -c constraint.txt

# Code and file presentation

## Code
Data needs to be downloaded at : https://github.com/CoFiF/Corpus because
Otherwise we could not upload the files.
The code folder contains subfolders whose names correspond to the different models used. Simply run the main file in a subfolder to launch the corresponding model.

It is also important to note that the various parameters can be adjusted in the lm_argparsers.py files.

## Data

In the Data folder, the CAC40 folder contains the initial data for all the reports for each of the CAC40 companies studied.

Then, the cleaned_reports folder contains the documents after processing used in our various scripts for training and evaluating our models.

Finally, the output folder contains the various prameters and files generated by our models, allowing the user to re-execute certain models without re-training.
